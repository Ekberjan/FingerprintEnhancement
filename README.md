# Fingerprint Image Enhancement Using OpenCV

Enhancement method is based on Anil Jain's paper:
'Fingerprint Image Enhancement: Algorithm and Performance Evaluation', IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 20, No. 8, August, 1998

The program performs image normalization, orientation calculation and Gabor filter based image enhancement. 

Keep in mind that the input file size is assumed to be no smaller than 300 x 300. If your input file is smaller than this, then try to resize your image, or edit the original code respectively. 

The code is developed under Visual Studio 2013, using OpenCV 2.4.10, so make your project configuration accordingly. 

Best,
